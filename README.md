# Darkness_detector
## Description
The Darkness Detector is a basic project that uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) and an Arduino Uno to detect the absence of light. When the ambient light level drops below a certain threshold, an LED turns on, indicating darkness. 
## Materials Required

### Hardware Requirement
- Arduino Uno
- LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- 10kΩ Resistor
- LED
- 270Ω Resistor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

### Software
- Arduino IDE

## Theory

### Principle of LDR
An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) is a resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity. It is used in light-sensing circuits. Below is an image of an LDR:
